# Splits #

`splits` is a cli tool for splitting files into peices such that any n peices can be reassembled into the original file. Ideally this is for hiding sensitive information between several locations where not all may be accessable. This program is rather inefficiant for large files because of the amount of extra data stored at each location. As a recommendation, any split file should be encrypted beforehand to prevent parts from having any meaning on their own.

## Dependancies ##

`splits` requires python 3 and `simplecrypt` to be installed.
